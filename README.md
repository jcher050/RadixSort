# RadixSort
 Purpose/Description: <  Implement (in Java) the radixSort algorithm to sort in  * increasing order an array of integer positive keys.  * public void radixSort(int arr[]) In your implementation you must consider that each key contains only even digits  * (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8). Your program must detect the case of odd digits in the  * keys, and, in this case, abort. >
